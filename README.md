# rock-paper-scissors

The goal of this project is to make a rock paper scissors game in which the player faces off against the computer. 

The first phase of the project consisted of simply prompting the player to select rock, paper or scissors against a computer with its own randomly generated option. The result of every round was displayed with console.logs. Finally, An alert would pop up when the player or the computer won the most rounds in 5 rounds. If neither had won, a tie would be shown. 

In the second phase, The Odin Project wanted us to include a user interface with buttons for the player options. The game is played until the computer or the player wins 5 rounds of RPS. The changes will be done within a new git branch, rps-ui. For the graphics, I chose to use the aesthectics of the gambling anime series Kaiji, adding sound effects from the show as well.
